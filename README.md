###### A tourism website which allows user to navigate through different packages, register and select different packages to book their tours. 

### Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS
This website is build using HTML5/CSS properties like Flex Box model, pseudoclasses, and media queries to make this web site responsive. Bootstrap is not used for the development since we are not allowed to use for this project.

### Note: 
The development for this website is still in progress. As a part of my academic course HTML/CSS I am buidling this website, which has only static content. Now I am working on further enhancement of this website to add dynamic contents,user validations using Javascript.
